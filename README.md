# ðŸ“Š JavaFx with bar chart

The goal of this project is to create a graphical user interface with JavaFx that will allow users to read information from a MySQL database and display it as chart data. I chose the data of "Visitor Arrivals & Japanese Overseas Travelers in 2023" from <https://www.jnto.go.jp/statistics/data/20231220_monthly.pdf>
